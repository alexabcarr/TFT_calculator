This is a calculator to determine the odds of rolling any given champion at any given time in TFT.

The number of each champion in the pool is represented as x/y, where x shows the current number and y is the maximum number for that champion. Users can manually increment/decrement the current number by 1 or 3 (to represent 2* units). 
Users can also manually enter the number of units left using the text field and clicking the check mark button.
You can reset the number of a target champion in the pool using the refresh button.

Using the two drop-down menus, users can select a target champion and their current level. Once entered, the expected number of the target champion in each shop will be output, along with the amount of gold the user should expect to spend to roll the target champion. 

The user can also reset the entire board to the default state using the wipe button in the bottom-right. Take care when doing so, as this is irreversible.
